Lover of dogs, impacting lives, and creating a cherished life in service of a missionWe are a married couple that owns an online personal development business and we have grown massively in the last few years and need some additional support in our life &amp; home. We are looking for an exceptional human to help us out!Are you ready to step into a fast paced, outcome and solution focused environment?Our business is booming — and we will expect you to step into a hybrid role. You may find yourself faced with unique challenges, that many people will not have the opportunity to create solutions for. We are investors — not only in business, but in life, in opportunities, and in the people around us.Let’s be honest… a lot of people who hire personal assistants SUCK. Whether hiring a PA, a house manager, a nanny, or any other “help oriented” role, those offering these jobs provide a steady stream of nightmares; gigantic egos with mismatched expectations, leaving employees scrambling to find somewhere else to work.We are looking for something different. We are looking for a partner in our life, who plays a meaningful role in our experience, our family, a valued confidant, a meticulous operational executive, whose attention to detail and execution is only bested by their energy, values, and soul.If you have seen Ironman, we are looking for our “Pepper”. If you have seen Batman Begins, we are looking for our Alfred (*or Allison).These individuals are characterized not by their ability to “do the tasks”, but rather by their leadership, reliability, and the connection to the individuals they serve and partner with.We are ready to invest in expanding our family — and we look forward to finding a member of our family through this process.—————————————————————————————————————-Are you into Personal Development? We need someone who’s internal drive to grow and contribute is perpetual .

Well, around our home we ARE BIG into stepping into an elevated version of self. If you love gossip and drama, this is NOT your place. If you thrive off of negativity — NEXT! If you have had past negative experiences with employers, we sympathize. However, we expect you to leave it at the door. We are not your average people, family or business.This opportunity requires a risk on your part — it requires coming forward with an open heart and mind. It will undoubtably be one of the most fulfilling journeys you could embark — should you choose to accept this mission.We need someone super smart, sharp, passionate and talented with a great attitude and a tremendous spirit of resourcefulness . We want someone who when they encounter an obstacle, wants to find a way around, through, over it, under it, etc. Someone who is detail oriented, has a very high standard of excellence and wants to make the world a better place, enriching the lives of others along the way.What is the last investment you’ve made in yourself and your life? Not interested in that… this will not be the place for you.If you have dreams and fears — and are willing to take on challenges with an aura of confidence, grit, determination, integrity and trust… we want you to apply!We expect someone who’s humble, teachable, and determined. Someone who doesn’t just like growing — they demand it.Do you get a sense of pride from organizing and giving everything a place? Are you a person that speaks the acts of service love language? Can you make a delicious, healthy meal, do you enjoy running errands, checking things off your to-do list, making a home have that cozy, sanctuary vibe? Do you love being thoughtful and adding little personal touches to the work you do? Do you feel as lit up doing laundry as you do negotiating with contractors?

The medical apparel industry is antiquated, highly fragmented and, until FIGS, was driven solely by low-cost providers offering a limited selection of poor quality products sold through third party distributors. FIGS is revolutionizing the medical apparel industry by creating the highest quality medical apparel in the world and by selling directly to medical professionals through our branded ecommerce site.

FIGS' foundation is built on product quality, and we have a relentless focus on three key areas: fabric, fit and function. We developed our proprietary, performance-oriented fabric technology to meet the demands of the medical profession. FIGS' Technical Collection fabric is wrinkle resistant, moisture-wicking, lightweight, breathable and offers four-way stretch. Our designs are tailored, sophisticated and innovative, incorporating features such as yoga waistbands, smart storage (pockets, zippers, hidden pockets) and inspirational sayings inside each garment that appeal to modern healthcare professionals.

By offering a branded and customer-centric online shopping experience, we are changing how medical professionals buy their workwear. Through our website, social media, and participation in medical conferences and events, we have built a strong following within the medical community and a meaningful connection with our customers, which allows us to understand their needs and to ensure that FIGS is continuously improving and innovating.

FIGS' Threads for Threads initiative is central to our mission. FIGS has donated hundreds of thousands of scrubs to healthcare providers in need around the world.",,Production Assistant,,,,,0:00:24.011920,https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=7c2ff9fd2407c0ce

This is a creative and administrative role with a broad range of responsibilities spanning travel, research, presentation, work at Blue Kazoo, and more.
You may be the right person for this role if you’re...
Extremely organized. Painfully organized. Excruciatingly organized. OK, maybe not excruciatingly, but you’re walking up to the edge…
Insufferably Detail-oriented. As in, not only did you notice the obvious mistake in the last bullet point, you saw the other one, too. And it annoyed you. It annoyed you so much, you thought, “There’s no way I could work for someone who didn’t catch that in a public job profile.”
Reasonably Artful. While not necessarily being an expert in any of these areas, you have a good eye for design, photography, video, writing, etc. People are impressed when they scroll through your Instagram feed.
Insatiably curious. What’s the best way to collect emails on a website? Even when a reservation for a restaurant isn’t available, is there another way to figure this out? You may not know, but you’re excited to find out.
Extremely internet aware. No trend or meme or latest platform escapes you. You were forged in the flames of cell phone addiction. You laugh in the face of that screen-time notification that Apple thinks we want to see every Sunday morning.
Practical.
Self-fueled. This role is relatively siloed and one-directional in asks.
Highly communicative...without expecting the same in return. Texting a list of everything you accomplished in a day is fun for you. Getting a thumbs up notification in return is all the affirmation you need.
And just pro-active. Obviously when you see a problem you fix it. But you also see opportunity and go after it even when there are no problems — just to make things better. Cuz you can. Back in the day, you might have been the babysitter who did the laundry.
General responsibilities...
Travel research, points hacking, and itinerary research + scheduling
Calendar management
Vendor management: researching personal help like house cleaners, cat-sitters
Irregular hours + weekend availability for time sensitive support
Research on events + various rabbit holes
Presentation of ideas + findings
Ability to neatly organize incoming tasks from many mediums of communications: text, voicemail, Volley/Voxer apps, Slack, email.
Follow-up + nudging to move things along
Project management
Example tasks…
Research all cool crypto conferences happening in 2022
Propose itinerary around work trips (including Airbnb’s/hotels based on detailed preferences, restaurants, rental car pick-ups)
Interview 10 candidates for cat-sitting
Ghost-write for LinkedIn posts
Find the best way to organize points log-ins + miles
Document a handbook of “things to know” on personal preferences for future fool-proof bookings
User Canva to create a mobile-friendly presentation summarizing the progress of tasks in the day/week
Must-have skills
Writing and copyediting
Research, research, research
General internet ingenuity
Task management (with a systematized productivity tool or method)
Nice-to-haves
Graphic design
Photography
Video editing
Location
Remote, but somewhere accessible to Santa Clarita and Glendale, California.

Netflix,jk=7dfbf94fa6a38a55,30+ days ago,"Los Angeles, California
Post Production Management
The Screening Operations team manages and operates Netflix’s in-house Exhibition &amp; Review Facilities across the globe. The team supports various clients, including Post-Production, Content Creative, Publicity, Awards, Talent Relations, and VFX, and directly interfaces with filmmakers, talent, and Animation Studio personnel working on Netflix Original content. Screening Operations facilitates a range of services: from reviews of in-progress material in post-production environments to external-facing showcases in a theatrical setting, our facilities feature groundbreaking latest technologies (DolbyAtmos, DolbyVision, large-scale display solutions) and are maintained to deliver best-in-class presentation. The team is committed to the preservation of creative intent and strives toward faithful reproduction of picture and sound while providing exceptional care to talent and filmmakers.
As a Coordinator on our Screening Operations team, you will be at the center of the operations. Acting as the face of the department, the Coordinator is the first point of contact for client requests and leads all communications. Keeping all the moving pieces aligned, the Coordinator ties together screening technicians, screening rooms, and screening assets for each request to ensure a successful event.
In this role, you will be impactful by:
Prioritizing the customer and end-user. This is primarily a customer service role serving various teams across multiple organizations. We are looking for a candidate who is able to anticipate client needs and takes pride in providing an excellent customer experience, acting as a guide to shepherd the client from booking to event conclusion. This includes identifying and determining client needs for each incoming request and involving the necessary cross-functional partners to attain a successful, well-supported screening.
Setting expectations and strategy for engagement. This team can’t be everywhere at once, so you will own calendar management, project assignments, and prioritization of tasks that the team is accountable for so all the bases are covered. You will be a key partner to our teammates in Post Production Management, Publicity, Awards, Content Acquisition, and Events to coordinate screening requests ranging from QC Sessions, Color-Critical Reviews, and Director’s Cut reviews to Premieres, Press Screenings, and Talent Screenings.
Fostering trusting and collaborative relationships with screening stakeholders. We want the experiences in our spaces to be world-class and authentic to the audiences they delight, and be able to course correct when we don’t get it right. You will identify where things fall short and celebrate the things that work, all while keeping transparency and feedback top of mind.
Cultivating rapport and relationships with cross-functional partners. Our team collaborates with multiple teams across Netflix to ensure the best possible screening experience as well as appropriate maintenance and repair work. These relationships are integral to providing our clients with an amazing event experience. You easily develop relationships with people from multiple backgrounds and teams, and know how to effectively collaborate to ensure every aspect needed to keep a screening running smoothly.
Embracing technology and all the joys that come with it! While prior knowledge of screening technology is not required, you are inquisitive and excited to learn. From documenting the equipment we need for a screening to interfacing with various engineering teams and resources to properly manage scheduled calibrations and maintenance of screening rooms, you are proactive in ensuring that our technical needs are met time and time again.
Personifying Netflix culture. Embracing the values of our company can be challenging, but you will rise to the occasion by participating in giving/receiving feedback, prioritizing candor and transparency in your communications, using data and technology to optimize your time, and using your natural curiosity to push yourself out of your comfort zone.
In this role, you will be expected to know:
Effective communication. Both your written and verbal communication skills are top-notch, and you are clear, comprehensive, and precise. You know how to cultivate understanding and how to clear up any miscommunication quickly and directly. You are comfortable communicating with all persons regardless of title or team and strive to treat all interactions equally.
Presentations and Training. You know how to develop an engaging and informative presentation deck, and how to present the data and information in an interesting and entertaining manner. You enjoy educating and guiding your viewers through the material whether your audience is composed of one person or 100 people.
Computer and Office Suite Familiarity. You are comfortable with word processing, spreadsheets, and slides; familiarity with Google Suite a plus. You’re comfortable asking questions and learn new software quickly.
Scheduling. You enjoy playing both calendar and technician tetris, and coordinating the logistics of multiple screenings happening across multiple locations in multiple time zones sounds fun!
Customer Service. You are exceptionally skilled at remaining poised, collected, and making a client feel like they are the main priority while multiple other things are happening simultaneously. You can be quick, concise, tactful and thoughtful regardless of the situation (or audience).
How to find the answers. You must be comfortable working in a technically-minded environment and able to answer questions about technical specifications, workflows, and technical requirements (or at the least point someone in the right direction or know who to ask to get the answer). Your natural curiosity and desire to learn will keep pushing you outside your comfort zone. Experience in production, post-production, and/or project management is a plus.
How to work quickly, creatively, and precisely while remaining flexible. Screening Operations fields an impressive number and variety of requests. You are adept at addressing multiple complex and competing priorities and precisely tracking all details for each event - while maintaining an ability to pivot at a moment’s notice when an event changes or cancels. You know how to multitask, stay organized, and share your methods with teammates so nothing falls through the cracks.
Critical thinking and problem solving. Facilitating finding solutions to competing requests for screening facilities and figuring out the best allocation of technician resources is energizing and intriguing. You love puzzles and are great at proposing multiple solutions quickly!

Cut to 2004. Jason moved to Los Angeles, looked around, and was like, ""Where's the bagels?"" Cut to 2014. Ten years and still no bagels?? Enough was enough. He bought a Hobart mixer, spent a year and a half baking a dozen a day, and here we are. He hopes you like your bagels the way he does. Crispy, chewy, a little yeasty and a little sweet.

(Full Time)

What we're doing isn't easy. But nothing worth doing ever is.

We envision a future powered by robots that work seamlessly with human teams. We build the artificial intelligence that enables service robots to collaborate with people and adapt to dynamic human environments. Join our mission-driven, venture-backed team as we build out our customer-facing operations arm.

As part of Diligent Robotics' founding operations team, you will uphold the highest standards for safe clinical use of robots in real-world hospital environments. Through excellent communication and documentation, you will work alongside the hospital staff and our engineering team while assisting a cutting-edge fleet of robots. As part of the founding team, you will help design and implement processes as the organization scales. Clinical Robot Associates will solve unexpected situations that might arise during a shift, and work effectively as a team to ensure exceptional results to our hospital partners.

This is a full-time entry-level role at Diligent Robotics. This position is located in Los Angeles and you must be local to be considered.

This is not an engineering position and a background in robotics or engineering is not required. If you have ever been an outstanding customer service representative helping busy customers with their needs, you may be a great fit for the role. If you are passionate about healthcare and technology, you are in the right place.

Your responsibilities will include:

Monitoring and safely assisting mobile service robots in a hospital environment (you will be onsite at various hospitals).
Collecting data and troubleshooting in a variety of real-world situations, while simultaneously providing detailed and accurate feedback to our engineers.
Prioritizing the customer experience, ensuring their expectations are always met or exceeded.
Communicating with hospital staff and, occasionally, the public regarding robot operation.

A good candidate would be, at minimum:

A high school graduate or possess a GED.
Customer-service oriented: you are friendly, skilled in the art of de-escalation, and an able juggler of customer demands and company needs.
An excellent written and verbal communicator: you convey information to internal stakeholders in phone calls and as the direct messenger.
Organized: you can juggle and make progress on multiple tasks simultaneously.
Self-sufficient: you get things done, learn what you don't know, and can make quick decisions independently, as circumstances require.
Able to lift up to 40 pounds: you are unfazed by the need to transport robot equipment on an occasional basis
Comfortable with a flexible work schedule. Hospitals never close! Understanding that your schedule may shift as customer needs change over time.
Willing to work during significant holidays: you understand that our customers (i.e. hospitals) don't shut down during the holidays and neither can our robots.
Willing to be vendor credentialed: our customers have strict standards and employment will be dependent on obtaining vendor credentials, the process of which will include various immunizations, a background check, a drug screen, among other steps.
A safe driver: you will be responsible for transporting equipment from remote locations to onsite deployments.
The ideal candidate would be:
Extraverted: you can strike up a conversation with anyone and everyone loves your presence
Responsive and responsible: you commit to deadlines, err on the side of over-communication, and understand the challenges of working with some co-workers that may be remote.
Results-oriented: you're happy to observe and take notes on end users interacting with the robot all day if that's what it takes to get data for product analysis.
Passionate about healthcare and technology coming together to help people
A video game enthusiast: you will leverage your off-duty skills to become an expert at teleoperating the robot, when necessary.
Formerly employed in the healthcare space: you have an insider understanding of the vernacular, organizational structure, and operational processes of hospitals.
Passionate and clear-eyed when it comes to robots: you understand that there's a gap between technological reality and media-driven expectations and are excited about the opportunity to move the industry forward by whatever means necessary, even if it isn't glamorous.
