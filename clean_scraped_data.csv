Lover of dogs, impacting lives, and creating a cherished life in service of a missionWe are a married couple that owns an online personal development business and we have grown massively in the last few years and need some additional support in our life &amp; home. We are looking for an exceptional human to help us out!Are you ready to step into a fast paced, outcome and solution focused environment?Our business is booming — and we will expect you to step into a hybrid role. You may find yourself faced with unique challenges, that many people will not have the opportunity to create solutions for. We are investors — not only in business, but in life, in opportunities, and in the people around us.Let’s be honest… a lot of people who hire personal assistants SUCK. Whether hiring a PA, a house manager, a nanny, or any other “help oriented” role, those offering these jobs provide a steady stream of nightmares; gigantic egos with mismatched expectations, leaving employees scrambling to find somewhere else to work.We are looking for something different. We are looking for a partner in our life, who plays a meaningful role in our experience, our family, a valued confidant, a meticulous operational executive, whose attention to detail and execution is only bested by their energy, values, and soul.If you have seen Ironman, we are looking for our “Pepper”. If you have seen Batman Begins, we are looking for our Alfred (*or Allison).These individuals are characterized not by their ability to “do the tasks”, but rather by their leadership, reliability, and the connection to the individuals they serve and partner with.We are ready to invest in expanding our family — and we look forward to finding a member of our family through this process.—————————————————————————————————————-Are you into Personal Development? We need someone who’s internal drive to grow and contribute is perpetual . We teach mindset mastery and success strategy, and the common denominator of all successful individuals is an elevated, developed mindset and perspective. No, we are not religious — Yes, we are fiercely spiritual. We are obsessed with evolving, and you MUST be as well.Have you heard of Tony Robbins? Well, around our home we ARE BIG into stepping into an elevated version of self. If you love gossip and drama, this is NOT your place. If you thrive off of negativity — NEXT! If you have had past negative experiences with employers, we sympathize. However, we expect you to leave it at the door. We are not your average people, family or business.This opportunity requires a risk on your part — it requires coming forward with an open heart and mind. It will undoubtably be one of the most fulfilling journeys you could embark — should you choose to accept this mission.We need someone super smart, sharp, passionate and talented with a great attitude and a tremendous spirit of resourcefulness . We want someone who when they encounter an obstacle, wants to find a way around, through, over it, under it, etc. Someone who is detail oriented, has a very high standard of excellence and wants to make the world a better place, enriching the lives of others along the way.What is the last investment you’ve made in yourself and your life? Not interested in that… this will not be the place for you.If you have dreams and fears — and are willing to take on challenges with an aura of confidence, grit, determination, integrity and trust… we want you to apply!We expect someone who’s humble, teachable, and determined. Someone who doesn’t just like growing — they demand it.Do you get a sense of pride from organizing and giving everything a place? Are you a person that speaks the acts of service love language? Can you make a delicious, healthy meal, do you enjoy running errands, checking things off your to-do list, making a home have that cozy, sanctuary vibe? Do you love being thoughtful and adding little personal touches to the work you do? Do you feel as lit up doing laundry as you do negotiating with contractors?

A little bit about us…

The medical apparel industry is antiquated, highly fragmented and, until FIGS, was driven solely by low-cost providers offering a limited selection of poor quality products sold through third party distributors. FIGS is revolutionizing the medical apparel industry by creating the highest quality medical apparel in the world and by selling directly to medical professionals through our branded ecommerce site.

FIGS' foundation is built on product quality, and we have a relentless focus on three key areas: fabric, fit and function. We developed our proprietary, performance-oriented fabric technology to meet the demands of the medical profession. FIGS' Technical Collection fabric is wrinkle resistant, moisture-wicking, lightweight, breathable and offers four-way stretch. Our designs are tailored, sophisticated and innovative, incorporating features such as yoga waistbands, smart storage (pockets, zippers, hidden pockets) and inspirational sayings inside each garment that appeal to modern healthcare professionals.

By offering a branded and customer-centric online shopping experience, we are changing how medical professionals buy their workwear. Through our website, social media, and participation in medical conferences and events, we have built a strong following within the medical community and a meaningful connection with our customers, which allows us to understand their needs and to ensure that FIGS is continuously improving and innovating.

FIGS' Threads for Threads initiative is central to our mission. FIGS has donated hundreds of thousands of scrubs to healthcare providers in need around the world."

At CarGurus, we use data and technology to make it simple, giving people the tools they need to confidently find, buy, finance, or sell a car. The best part? Our work makes a real impact. We're the most-visited car-shopping site in the US and we are growing fast in our international markets. Ready to come along for the ride?

The Field Account Manager (FAM) role oversees our largest Dealer Partnerships and is responsible for the end-to-end lifecycle of paying customers. A FAM has a strong relationship with both internal (Regional Sales Directors) and external (Dealer Partners) stakeholders. FAMs are responsible for providing effective consultation to customers through regular performance analysis and support. FAMs work closely with Regional Sales Directors (RSD) to drive growth within the existing customer base through product upgrades, new product sales, and renewals. Through effective relationship management and proactive engagement, the primary objectives of a FAM are to protect against dealership churn, deliver an unparalleled customer experience, and drive the growth of product and services usage.

What You'll Do:
Manage account base of roughly 350-400 paying accounts (60-70 groups)
Become a subject matter expert on all CarGurus products (Listings Packages, Digital Suite, Data, Wholesale, and Retailing products) and services (to provide all levels of technical support)
Cultivate partnerships with Regional Sales Directors to work in tandem on shared accounts
Conduct regular in-person meetings accounts to educate how to maximize the value of the CarGurus platform (15%-20% of time)
Complete post-sale onboarding for new dealerships and dealership personnel
Provide dealership and group-level performance analysis; identify areas of potential improvement
Advance cross-departmental collaboration (Support, Billing, Data Integrity, Product and Engineering) to convey key issues and promote new ideas within the CarGurus organization
Develop deep and wide-ranging relationships with dealership decision makers and staff, in-person and remotely via phone and meeting tools, to increase our span of influence and number of CarGurus champions within the dealership
Prospect, identify, and qualify upsell/cross-sell opportunities and renewal candidates to directly support MRR expansion efforts
Generate and progress sales-qualified leads to be closed by Regional Sales Directors

In summary, the Field Account Manager provides ongoing support to maximize the overall level of client satisfaction and minimize customer churn. To ensure the best customer experience and in turn an increase in product adoption, stickiness, and revenue per dealer, the FAM collaborates in lockstep with their RSD counterparts to create a seamless spectrum of CarGurus engagement for any customer. From initial onboarding through steady proactive and strategic consultation, a FAM serves as the face of CarGurus and trusted advisor to customers throughout the partnership lifecycle.

CarGurus Culture:

Research shows that while men apply to jobs when they meet an average of 60% of the criteria, women and other marginalized folks tend to only apply when they check every box. So if you think you have what it takes, but don't necessarily meet every single point on the job description, please still get in touch. We'd love to have a chat and see if you could be a great fit.

At CarGurus, we invest in our people's professional growth with everything from learning and development programs to tuition reimbursement. Want to work on projects that expand your skill set without sacrificing your work/life balance? You got it. We also strive to provide perks and benefits that employees actually care about like free lunch, commuter subsidies, and more. That includes equity in the company—our way of showing that we want you here for the long haul.

We work hard every day to build the world's most trusted and transparent automotive marketplace, but trust and transparency don't just apply to our consumers. They extend to our talent, too. We aim to create a workplace where everyone feels they can bring the ultimate expression of themselves and their potential—where you don't just fit, you thrive.
